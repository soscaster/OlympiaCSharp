# Road to Mount Olympia (Server-Side App)

## Disclaimer: This is NOT an official application made and used by VTV (Vietnam Television)

* This is an individual project 👍
* The main purpose is just recreating a program which... J4F 😆
* I want to try something new 🆕
* Please don't steal my code. You can just use Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT or anything else to make from scratch.
* GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are my friends. However, I only meet them and ask them when some functions is too complicated to do.
* This application is server-side. I'll code a client-side at the same time but I'l store it at a different repository.

## Main things:
* Beautiful splash screen, and of course, J4F and doesn't do anything 🤡
* Main UI, where I put all things in there, since I don't want to split too much Windows Forms. Too M10 ⚽
* Read Excel file, store the data to a gigantic board aka. DATABASE
* Open a server, for communicating with clients 🖥️
* Control things... kind of?
* ... that's it.
